    I researched how to create .txt files in PyCharm 2019 and add them to my Git directory as well as looking through
    all the folders to better understand the situation. I also edited README.md to mention this file, and researched how
    python functions and modules can be run from the console / Git Bash. Additionally, I took the liberty of reading
    through the usage() module to understand its inner workings.

    I finished coding and commenting cat in concatenate.py, and I worked on the code for WordCount.py. However, I did not
    have a clue on how to count the words in the comma-Delimited data/people file and then figured out that I was trying
    to delimit data/people by commas instead of by just the spaces and I was able to finish WordCount.py. I was also
    able to complete the functional code for head() in which I also figured out how to make it accept a "-n NUMBER" kind
    of output.
