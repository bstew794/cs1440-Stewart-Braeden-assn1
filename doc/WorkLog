    I researched how to create .txt files in PyCharm 2019 and add them to my Git directory as well as looking through
    all the folders to better understand the situation. I also edited README.md to mention this file, and researched how
    python functions and modules can be run from the console / Git Bash. Additionally, I took the liberty of reading
    through the usage() module to understand its inner workings.

    I finished coding and commenting cat in concatenate.py, and I worked on the code for WordCount.py. However, I did not
    have a clue on how to count the words in the comma-Delimited data/people file and then figured out that I was trying
    to delimit data/people by commas instead of by just the spaces and I was able to finish WordCount.py. I was also
    able to complete the functional code for head() in which I also figured out how to make it accept a "-n NUMBER" kind
    of output.

    I finished coding and commenting Grep.py, and I finished the comments of head() in Partial.py along with adding the
    necessary if statements to run grep() from the command line. I also completed the coding and commenting for tail()
    in Partial.py. However, I am dissatisfied with the efficiency of my tail() function because it has to read through
    the entire file twice. Additionally, I coded the error messages to be used for not enough arguments and for when an
    invalid number of lines is given. tt.py should now display an error message for an invalid command. I also finally
    finished the coding and documentation for cat() in concatenate.py.
